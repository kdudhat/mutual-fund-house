## About project flow

I have used redux for store user data, credentials and mutual fund data.

so it will first go to sign page and here you have to required to do sign up.

After completing signup process you have to move on signin page and after that you have to move on product listing page in same page it will show product details based on select product from left side.

You can change user data clicking on 'My Account'.

And clicking on signout, user signout from application.s
